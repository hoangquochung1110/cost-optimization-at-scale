# Scaling Organizational Cost Control: Practical Deployment of AWS Config

Learn how to configure AWS Config rules, package them into a single unit â€” Conformance Packs.
This enables you to deploy and manage hundreds of Config rules across your AWS Organization and
ensure consistent compliance standards across all accounts and regions with a single action.

It also automates remediation workflows through Systems Manager, integrated with AWS Config
Aggregator as the central hub for collecting and monitoring compliance data from all accounts in
your organization.
