This service is optional for this workshop; however, to conveniently switch between the delegated administrator account and other member accounts, enabling AWS Identity Center is recommended.

You can refer to the detailed guide in the workshop [Using AWS IAM Identity Center for robust identity management](https://000012.awsstudygroup.com/vi/)
