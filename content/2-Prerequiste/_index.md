To prepare the multi-account environment and automate the creation of resources and infrastructure (monitoring, compliance, etc.), we need to perform the following steps:

- [Enable AWS Organizations](2.1-createorganization/)
- [Set up a Landing Zone (AWS Control Tower)](2.2-createlandingzone/)
- [Configure AWS Identity Center](2.3-sso/)
- [Activate trusted access for CloudFormation StackSets](2.4-activatetrustedaccessforstacksets/)

ðŸ’¡ AWS Organizations allows centralized multi-account management, AWS Control Tower Landing Zone automates the setup of related monitoring and security services following AWS best practices, and AWS Identity Center enables seamless account switching among member accounts.
