We will create an EBS volume with type gp2 to test the solution:

1. Sign in again using a member account.

2. Navigate to the EC2 service.

3. In the left navigation pane, select **Volumes**.

4. Create a new volume with the following properties, making sure to choose the **gp2** volume type.

5. After creation succeeds, verify the volume state, then navigate to AWS Config.  
   
   ðŸ’¡ Note the EBS volume ID to correlate with the AWS Config Conformance Pack evaluation results.

6. Select the Conformance Pack named `Cost-Optimization` (or similar).

7. Click **View** to see the list of rules.  
   
   Since the newly created EBS volume is gp2 and unattached to any EC2 instance, two rules will be marked as noncompliant.

8. Click the `CostOpt-Ebs-Gp3` rule to open the rule dashboard.  
   
   The dashboard lists EBS volumes violating the gp3 requirement, showing the same ID as our new volume.

9. To remediate, click the **Remediate** button.

10. Wait a moment, then check the **Status** column as shown below:  
    ![AWS Config Conformance Pack rule](/images/6.test/008-test.png)  
   
    The EBS volume will disappear from the dashboard once it becomes compliant.

11. Verify the properties of the updated EBS volume:
