### Overview

We will use the Audit account to deploy resources in the solution using AWS CloudFormation, including:

- A CloudFormation StackSet: deploys a set of resources in bulk to multiple accounts
- A CloudFormation Stack: deploys supporting resources to help distribute the resources defined in the CloudFormation StackSet to the designated member accounts.
