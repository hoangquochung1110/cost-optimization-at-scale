1. Check AWS Lambda functions

    ![Lambda functions](/images/5.conformancepack/013-validate-lambda.png)

    We have 3 Lambda functions:
    
    - `CostOptimizationConfPack-GetOrgDetailsFunction` contains logic to list member accounts, excluding the administrator account from the CloudFormation deployment targets
    
    - `CostOptimizationConfPack-ShareDocumentFunction` contains logic to share the SSM Document created by the delegated administrator account, granting read access to member accounts
    
    - `CostOptimizationConformanceConfigRuleFunction` defines the evaluation logic for the custom AWS Config rule

2. Check AWS Systems Manager Document:

    - Navigate to the Systems Manager service page, then select "Documents" from the left navigation pane:

    - Select the "Owned by me" tab and verify that there is a document named `CostOptimizationConfPack-EbsGp3Remediation`

        ![Systems Manager overview](/images/5.conformancepack/015-systemsmanager.png)

    - Select the document and view its content:

        This document takes an EBS volume ID as input and modifies the corresponding EBS volume type to gp3
